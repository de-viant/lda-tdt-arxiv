Project for Web Technology subject, Topic - TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking)

The present study employed the LDA topic model to investigate the discovery of topics. In essence, the LDA model was utilized to infer the representation of a fixed number of topics from a given corpus and their respective distribution. Additionally, we explored other topic models, such as LSA, and compared their outcomes against those of the LDA model. Ultimately, we found that LDA topics exhibited greater accuracy and interpretability. 

To assess the efficacy of the topic model, we computed topic coherence, which provides a measure of topic consistency. As an unsupervised learning approach, we generated visualizations across a range of topics from 3 to 100. The resulting topics were both diverse and well-defined, with clear and identifiable labels, such as Language, LifeScience, and Theory.
